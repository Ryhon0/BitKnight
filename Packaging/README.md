# Packaging
Before packaging make sure you've installed the export templates (Editor > Manage Export Templates...)

To export and package the project run `package-all` with the `GODOT` enviroment variable set to your Godot executable path e.g. `GODOT=/usr/bin/godot-mono ./package-all`

If you wish to create a .dmg installer for MacOS you will need a machine running MacOS. [Read this for more info](OSXDMG.md)
